          People (esp. parents) got quite upset in the beginning after the first cohort of the Thiel Fellowship was announced. $100k to drop out of college, in a world where finishing a degree at university is the no. 1 thing that "elite" kids do, was certainly contrarian. It sure paid off to work on something on your own, rather than attending classes. Dylan Field created Figma at 19 – a design startup Adobe was set to buy for $20 billion. Vitalik Buterin began developing Ethereum, now worth hundreds of billions, while still a teenager. These prodigies thrived thanks to the Thiel Fellowship. 
          We know Europe isn't doing too well. Europe's whole tech sector is worth less than Apple alone. None of the Top 20 tech companies by market cap are European. US tech companies invest 2x more in R&D than European firms. And it's accelerating. The issue is systemic across financing, regulation and culture.
          It doesn't make sense to blindly copy something from the US, or from anywhere else for that matter. We need to invent something new that fits a European context and markets, while maintaining the growth and abundance objective. With our European Defense Tech Hub intiative, we're seeing the early signs of the pan-European unification of startups and markets. The founders are united around a European agenda, without regard for national goals.

          Lessons from the Thiel Fellowship Success
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Peter Thiel’s “20 Under 20” Fellowship in the U.S. has proven that early bets on young talent can yield outsized returns. They each get $100k to drop out of university and work on a project of their choice. Over 200 Thiel Fellows’ companies are collectively valued at over $220 billion, and by 2023, 11 of the program’s alumni had founded unicorns. Figma, Ethereum, OYO Rooms, and Loom are just a few standout examples.
          College in the US has different connotations than in Europe, with a high financial cost and "industrialization" of the college system vs. in Europe where almost everyone who is qualified can study something at a reasonable cost. So it's less important for a European Fellowship to be counter-academia, though the opportunity cost of chasing grades and certificates is real.
          Another important factor of success for the Thiel Fellows is that they not only get funding but also mentorship and a community. The Thiel Fellowship helped create a culture where stepping away from a traditional path to chase a huge vision became a viable option. Europe can reap similar rewards by cultivating its young visionaries.

          The Mafia-Effect
          Each new European unicorn can create thousands of jobs and foster entire new industries. On top of that, they also create "Mafias" of the next generation of founders who spin-out and build new companies. Skype's founders not only built an $8.5 billion company but also spawned over 900 new companies in the years that followed. The same for Spotify, Klarna, iZettle, Rocket Internet, Revolut and many more. This kind of multiplier effect could be replicated as fellowship graduates start businesses and inspire others.

          We would also like there to be a shift in what types of ventures are funded in Europe. A fellowship of $100-150k would allow a fellow to get to a seemingly insane idea to a stage that is more appetizing and backable. When talking to an average European VC or LP, they often ask "what can go wrong". Germany and Europe is filled with "Bedenkenträger". The vibe won't shift on its own, we need to actively change it, and make people see the abundant future possible if we explore more "out there" ideas.

          Building a non-academic elite institution
          Arguably, being a Thiel Fellow in the US is more prestigious than getting into an Ivy League university. But what would the equivalent in Europe be? We have the Nobel prize, but it's for academic achievements only, and mostly post-career recognition. Otherwise there are a few exclusive scholarships but the criteria and selections are fairly conservative and with unclear predictive potential for entrepreneurial success. 
          By being extremely selective with fellows and ideas, while not advertising widely, we can generate a certain je-ne-sais-quoi and mystique around such a fellowship. To take it even further, one could imagine elaborate treasure hunts (like at MIT), puzzles of extreme difficulty, or a sort of X-Olympics where general genius and orthogonal thinking is measured. Imagine a sort of decathlon but the disciplines are Go, physics, maths, Diplomacy, FPV-flying, designing a competition, convincing all other competitors to play it, and then win, etc. It would be a marketing strategy for attracting otherworldly talent. 
          Previously, this type of elite institution might have been a private club, a scientific society, secret order or cabal, except they were usually not merit-based, now this has to be different. Social motivators can be much stronger than money. The Thiel-fellowship has this "private club" feeling in the US.

          The Importance Of Peer Pressure
          A crucial component to building a top-notch set of outcomes post-selection, is the physical proximity to others who are challenging you. Humans are creatures of comfort and habits, if we're not challenged we grow lazy. For many, this external input comes from the internet. It might seem like it matters less that you live on a farm in Romania if you have a Starlink and are terminally online, seeking out your community there. However, if you've ever spent even a week, or longer in a group of people that constantly push and challenge each other, you'll notice that it's much harder to continue half-assing everything. If your peers are designing a new battery, or coming up with the next transformer-level architecture, it's hard to continue working on a GPT-wrapper. 
          These aren't even that far-fetched scenarios; recall that one Thiel Fellow at age 17 achieved nuclear fusion in a garage, and another started a venture to clean the ocean’s plastic pollution before turning 22. Empowering talented youth to work on such problems could accelerate technological progress that benefits all of society. Europe’s research institutions would also benefit, as more breakthroughs make the jump from lab to market via entrepreneurial young minds.
          Anyone who has attended any higher education knows that <Link to="https://danwang.co/college-girardian-terror/" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 mb-8 block">  mimetic contagion</Link> is real, and removes even more of what we think is free will and differentiated opinions. Does it matter that we *could* choose to do almost anything if 99% of our peers are doing very traditional things such as consulting and banking. The new norm seems to be to start a vertical AI company...

          Conclusion: Unlocking Europe’s Future
          A Thiel Fellowship-style program in Europe isn’t a wild fantasy, it’s the logical next step for a continent that wants to remain economically dynamic, culturally vibrant, and technologically competitive. We have the talent, the capital, and increasingly the political will to make it happen. Early signs of change are already here: initiatives like Project Europe have drawn support from over 100 of the continent’s top tech leaders. And it's great, but we need even earlier, more open-ended, founder-friendly initiatives and funding opportunities.
          To truly unlock Europe’s potential, we need to think bigger and bolder. I want more supersonic airplanes, pan-European bio-firms, Swedish and Finnish metal refinement, Swiss photonic foundries and the next transformer-like architecture invented, incorporated and commercialized in Europe! Funded by whoever can convince those founders they are worthy of investing. By institutionalizing a pan-European fellowship that bets on our youth, we send a message of optimism and confidence in our own people. For investors, it’s a chance to back tomorrow’s Googles, Intels and OpenAIs while they’re being built in our own backyard. For young technical minds, it’s a call to action – you don’t have to go to Silicon Valley or wait until graduation to change the world! Europe is ready to support your moonshot. The benefits: 
          - economic growth  
          - innovation culture, and 
          - leadership in future technologies 
          are ours to seize. 

          It’s time to give Europe’s brightest young innovators the chance to take off!
